Random Thoughts
---------------
I haven't done anything with GraphQL before besides reading a bit of the docs
in the past.

I attempted to make my required changes while following the current project
structure as much as possible.

I through the seeded users and features right into migrations for simplicity.

The existing project did not have zod installed, so I did not go down the path
of using zod runtime validation.

Even though it's usually not a good idea to expose an incrementing table id
publically, I used the UserAccount id as the exposed identifier as to not change
the underlying UserAccount model. (Assuming this isn't just an internal API).

INSERT INTO feature_flag_value(feature_flag_fk, user_account_fk, "value")
VALUES
    (1, 1, 'false')
    ,(1, 2, 'false')
    ,(1, 3, 'true')
    ,(1, 4, 'true')
    ,(2, 2, 'orange')
    ,(2, 3, 'orange')
    ,(2, 4, 'purple')
    ,(3, 3, 'red')
    ,(4, 2, '["revenue","donations"]')
    ,(4, 4, '["donations"]')
    ,(5, 2, '{"header":{"font-size":"16px","color":"yellow"},"footer":{"color":"grey"}}')
    ,(5, 4, '{"header":{"font-size":"16px"},"footer":{"color":"grey"}}')
;
